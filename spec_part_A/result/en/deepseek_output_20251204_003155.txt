We are given: "hypothetical GPT-6 model with 100 trillion parameters (10¹⁴)". So N = 10^14.
Part (a): Chinchilla scaling laws: For given compute budget C in FLOP, optimal parameter count N and token count D scale as:
N = 0.1 * C^{0.5} and D = 1.7 * C^{0.5}.
We are given N = 10^14. So we solve for C:
10^14 = 0.1 * C^{0.5} => C^{0.5} = (10^14) / 0.1 = 10^14 * 10 = 10^15.
So C^{0.5} = 10^15, then C = (10^15)^2 = 10^30 FLOP.
Then D = 1.7 * C^{0.5} = 1.7 * 10^15 = 1.7e15 tokens.
So answers: C = 10^30 FLOP, D = 1.7e15 tokens.

Part (b): Dataset size in human terms. Each English word ~1.4 tokens. Each page contains 400 words, so tokens per page = 400 * 1.4 = 560 tokens/page. Each book has 300 pages, so tokens per book = 300 * 560 = 168,000 tokens/book.
Now D = 1.7e15 tokens. Number of books = D / (tokens per book) = 1.7e15 / 1.68e5 = (1.7/1.68) * 10^(15-5) ≈ 1.0119 * 10^10 ≈ 1.012e10 books.
That is about 10.1 billion books.
Library of Congress: roughly 20 million volumes = 2e7 volumes.
So number of Library of Congresses = (1.012e10)/(2e7) = 506. So about 506 times the size of the Library of Congress.

Part (c): Memory requirements. Each 16-bit parameter occupies 2 bytes. So total memory for parameters = (10^14 parameters) * (2 bytes/parameter) = 2e14 bytes.
Convert to GB: 1 GB = 10^9 bytes? Actually 1 GB = 2^30 bytes ≈ 1.0737e9 bytes, but often in these estimations we use 10^9. Similarly, 1 TB = 10^12 bytes. So 2e14 bytes = 2e14 / 1e9 = 2e5 GB = 200,000 GB. In TB: 2e14 / 1e12 = 200 TB.
Given H200 GPU has about 100 GB of VRAM. To hold the model in memory, we need number of GPUs = total memory / memory per GPU = 200,000 GB / 100 GB = 2000 GPUs. But careful: Actually 2e14 bytes = 2e14 / (10^9) = 2e5 GB, exactly 200,000 GB. 200,000/100 = 2000. So 2000 GPUs.
But note: Often model parallelism requires storing parameters across GPUs, so that's the minimum number just to store parameters. Possibly more if we need replicas.

Part (d): Inference latency and throughput. During inference, model parameters must be loaded from GPU memory. The H200 has memory bandwidth of 4.8 TB/s = 4.8 * 10^12 bytes/s.
We need to perform one forward pass. In a forward pass, typically each parameter is used once? Actually for transformer models, the inference computation involves loading all parameters once per forward pass? But careful: The minimal time to perform one forward pass might be limited by memory bandwidth if the model is memory-bound. Often we consider the time to read all parameters from memory. So if we need to read all parameters (2e14 bytes) from GPU memory, then the time = total bytes / bandwidth = 2e14 bytes / (4.8e12 bytes/s) = (2/4.8) * 10^(14-12) = 0.4167 * 10^2 = 41.67 seconds? Actually: 2e14 / 4.8e12 = (2/4.8)*10^2 = 0.41667*100 = 41.667 seconds. But that seems too high for one forward pass? Possibly we assume that parameters are stored across many GPUs, and each GPU only holds a portion. But the question says: "During inference, model parameters must be loaded from GPU memory. The H200 has a memory bandwidth of 4.8 TB/s. What is the minimal time in seconds to perform one forward pass through GPT-6?" It likely means if we have to load all parameters from memory to compute the forward pass, the bandwidth limits how quickly we can read them. But maybe the parameters are already in memory? Actually "loaded from GPU memory" might mean they are already in VRAM, so we just read them. The time to read all parameters is the memory bound. So minimal time = size of parameters / bandwidth. That gives about 41.7 seconds. But that is for one forward pass. If the model generates tokens autoregressively, one token per forward pass, then to generate one token we need one forward pass, so time per token = 41.7 seconds. Then tokens per minute = 60 / 41.7 ≈ 1.44 tokens/minute. That seems extremely slow. Possibly I misinterpret: Maybe the forward pass doesn't require reading all parameters? In transformer inference, for each token generation, we do need to use all parameters? Actually yes, the entire model is used to compute the next token. But in practice, with many GPUs, the parameters are distributed and computation is parallelized, so the bandwidth might be aggregate across many GPUs. But the question says "the H200 has a memory bandwidth of 4.8 TB/s." It might be per GPU. If we use many GPUs, the aggregate bandwidth increases. But the question likely assumes a single GPU? But in part (c) we needed 2000 GPUs to hold the model. So in inference, we might use all those GPUs, and the aggregate bandwidth would be 2000 * 4.8 TB/s? But careful: The question for part (d) might be considering a single GPU? Possibly not. Let's read: "During inference, model parameters must be loaded from GPU memory. The H200 has a memory bandwidth of 4.8 TB/s. What is the minimal time in seconds to perform one forward pass through GPT-6?" It doesn't specify how many GPUs. Possibly they assume the model is stored on a single H200? But that's impossible because the model is 200 TB and H200 has 100 GB VRAM. So we must assume we have enough GPUs to hold the model. And then the memory bandwidth aggregate is the sum of bandwidths of all GPUs? Actually when doing distributed inference, each GPU holds a portion of the model, and during forward pass, each GPU reads its own parameters from its own memory. So the time to read parameters across all GPUs is determined by the slowest GPU? But if they operate in parallel, the time to read the parameters from each GPU's memory is proportional to the size of parameters on that GPU. If the model is evenly distributed across N GPUs, each GPU holds (total parameters / N) parameters. Then the time to read its portion is (parameters per GPU * 2 bytes) / (bandwidth per GPU). Since all GPUs do it in parallel, the overall time is that time. So if we use M GPUs, then parameters per GPU = total parameters / M. Then time per forward pass = (total parameters * 2 / M) / (bandwidth per GPU) = (total bytes) / (M * bandwidth per GPU) = total bytes / (aggregate bandwidth). So indeed, if we have enough GPUs to hold the model, the minimal time to perform one forward pass is total bytes divided by aggregate memory bandwidth of all GPUs. But careful: That assumes perfect parallelism and that reading parameters is the only bottleneck. But the question likely expects us to use the single GPU bandwidth? Possibly they want to compute the time if we had to load the model from memory? Possibly they want the time if we use one GPU, but since the model doesn't fit, we have to load it in chunks? That would be more complicated. Alternatively, they might be asking for the time to load the entire model from memory into the compute units, assuming it is all in GPU memory already. Even if it is distributed, the time to read all parameters from the GPU memory (across all GPUs) is the same as if we had a single memory with aggregate bandwidth. So we can compute aggregate bandwidth if we know how many GPUs we need. From part (c), we need 2000 GPUs to store the model. So if we use 2000 H200 GPUs, each with 4.8 TB/s bandwidth, aggregate bandwidth = 2000 * 4.8 TB/s = 9600 TB/s = 9.6e3 * 1e12 = 9.6e15 bytes/s? Wait: 4.8 TB/s = 4.8 * 10^12 bytes/s. So 2000 * 4.8e12 = 9.6e15 bytes/s. Then time to read all parameters = total bytes (2e14) / aggregate bandwidth (9.6e15) = 2e14 / 9.6e15 = 2.083e-2 seconds = 0.02083 seconds. That is about 20.8 milliseconds per forward pass. That seems more reasonable. But the question says: "The H200 has a memory bandwidth of 4.8 TB/s." It does not specify that we are using multiple GPUs. However, part (c) asked how many GPUs would be needed just to hold the model, so it's natural to assume for inference we would use at least that many GPUs. But the question in part (d) might be independent: It might be asking: if we had to load the model parameters from memory (assuming they are stored somewhere) to perform a forward pass, what is the minimal time given the memory bandwidth? Possibly they expect us to use the total model size and divide by the bandwidth, getting a large number. Let's see typical numbers: For GPT-3 with 175B parameters, if stored in fp16, that's 350 GB. A100 has bandwidth around 2 TB/s, so time to load parameters is 350e9 / 2e12 = 0.175 seconds. That is plausible for a forward pass? Actually GPT-3 inference latency for one token can be on the order of hundreds of milliseconds. So that's not too far. For 100T parameters, 200 TB, with 4.8 TB/s, single GPU would take 200e12 / 4.8e12 = 41.67 seconds. That seems too high. In practice, they would use many GPUs. So I'll check the problem statement: It says "During inference, model parameters must be loaded from GPU memory." That suggests the parameters are already in GPU memory, so we don't load from CPU, we just access them from GPU memory. So the bottleneck is how fast we can read them from GPU memory to the compute units. That is the memory bandwidth. And if we have multiple GPUs, each GPU only reads its own portion, so the effective bandwidth is the sum. So I think we should use the number of GPUs from part (c) to compute the aggregate bandwidth. But careful: The question might be standalone: It gives the H200 specs, and asks for minimal time to perform one forward pass. Possibly they expect us to compute the time based on the total size and the bandwidth, ignoring multiple GPUs. However, the phrase "minimal time" might imply we consider the best possible scenario where we have enough GPUs to hold the model and they work perfectly in parallel. So I'll compute both ways and see which one seems more appropriate. Possibly the intended interpretation: Since in part (c) we computed the number of GPUs needed to hold the model, we can use that number to compute the aggregate bandwidth. Then time = total model size / (number of GPUs * bandwidth per GPU). That gives a reasonable number. Alternatively, if we assume we have to load the model into a single GPU's memory for inference, but the model doesn't fit, we would have to load it in chunks, and the time would be even longer. But the minimal time would be if we could stream the entire model through the GPU memory, but then the GPU would need to process it in one pass, which might not be possible due to limited memory. So the minimal feasible time likely requires enough GPUs to hold the model. So I'll use the number of GPUs from (c) to compute aggregate bandwidth.

So let's do: Number of GPUs from (c): 2000 GPUs.
Aggregate bandwidth = 2000 * 4.8 TB/s = 9600 TB/s = 9.6e3 TB/s = 9.6e3 * 1e12 bytes/s = 9.6e15 bytes/s.
Total model size = 2e14 bytes.
Time per forward pass = 2e14 / 9.6e15 = 2.083e-2 s = 0.02083 s.
Then if generating tokens autoregressively, one token per forward pass, tokens per second = 1 / 0.02083 ≈ 48 tokens/s. In one minute: 48 * 60 = 2880 tokens. So about 2880 tokens per minute.

But wait: Is that correct? That seems high for such a large model. Possibly the forward pass computation is also compute-bound, not just memory-bound. But the question says "minimal time to perform one forward pass through GPT-6?" and mentions memory bandwidth, so they want the memory-bound time. So I'll go with that.

Alternatively, if they intended a single GPU, time = 41.67 s per forward pass, tokens per minute = 60/41.67 ≈ 1.44 tokens. That seems too low. Given that part (e) talks about training on H200 GPUs, it's likely that we consider using many GPUs. So I'll use the aggregate bandwidth approach.

I'll state: Assuming the model is distributed across the minimum number of GPUs required to hold it (2000 GPUs), the aggregate memory bandwidth is 2000 * 4.8 TB/s = 9600 TB/s. Then minimal time per forward pass = model size / aggregate bandwidth = 200 TB / 9600 TB/s = 0.02083 s. But careful: 200 TB = 200 * 10^12 bytes? Actually 1 TB = 10^12 bytes, so 200 TB = 2e14 bytes, and 9600 TB/s = 9.6e15 bytes/s, so indeed 2e14/9.6e15 = 2.083e-2 s. So I'll compute exactly: 2e14 / (2000 * 4.8e12) = 2e14 / (9.6e15) = 0.02083 s. So about 0.021 seconds.

Then tokens per minute: 60 / 0.02083 ≈ 2880 tokens. Roughly 2.88e3 tokens per minute.

I'll also note that if we consider a single GPU, time would be much larger. I'll mention both? But the problem likely expects a single number. Given that part (c) asked for number of GPUs to hold the model, it's natural to use that number in part (d). So I'll proceed.

Part (e): Training cost in FLOPs and dollars. We have from part (a): C = 10^30 FLOP. But careful: The compute C is in FLOP (floating point operations). Training compute is often measured in petaFLOP-days. One petaFLOP-day = 8.64e19 FLOP (since 1 petaFLOP = 1e15 FLOP/s, and day = 86400 s, so 1e15 * 86400 = 8.64e19 FLOP). 
First, we are asked: "If trained on H200 GPUs (each delivering 1.98 petaFLOP/s and renting for $1.50/hour), how much would it cost to train GPT-3?" We need to compute the cost to train GPT-3 given that GPT-3 required 3640 petaFLOP-days. So first, convert petaFLOP-days to FLOP: 3640 petaFLOP-days = 3640 * 8.64e19 FLOP = ? Let's compute: 3640 * 8.64e19 = 3.64e3 * 8.64e19 = 3.14496e23 FLOP? Actually: 8.64e19 * 3640 = 8.64e19 * 3.64e3 = 8.64*3.64 * 10^(19+3) = 31.4496 * 10^22 = 3.14496e23 FLOP. But we don't need that; we can compute directly in petaFLOP-days.

Given an H200 delivers 1.98 petaFLOP/s. Note: That is peak FLOPs. So the number of H200 GPU-seconds required to achieve the compute: Compute in petaFLOP-seconds = (3640 petaFLOP-days) * (86400 seconds/day) because 1 petaFLOP-day = 1 petaFLOP sustained for one day = 1e15 FLOP/s * 86400 s = 8.64e19 FLOP, but in petaFLOP units: 1 petaFLOP-day = 1 petaFLOP * 1 day = (1e15 FLOP/s) * 86400 s = 8.64e19 FLOP. So if we measure compute in petaFLOP-days, then the number of petaFLOP-seconds is: Compute (in petaFLOP-days) * 86400 (seconds/day). So for GPT-3: Compute in petaFLOP-seconds = 3640 * 86400 = ? Let's compute: 3640 * 86400 = 3640 * 8.64e4 = 3.64e3 * 8.64e4 = 3.14496e8 petaFLOP-seconds.
Each H200 delivers 1.98 petaFLOP/s. So number of H200 GPU-seconds needed = (compute in petaFLOP-seconds) / (1.98 petaFLOP/s per GPU) = 3.14496e8 / 1.98 ≈ 1.58836e8 GPU-seconds.
Now, renting cost: $1.50 per hour per GPU. So cost per GPU-second = $1.50 / 3600 = $0.00041667 per second.
Total cost = (GPU-seconds) * (cost per GPU-second) = 1.58836e8 * 0.00041667 ≈ ? Alternatively, compute in hours: Number of GPU-hours = GPU-seconds / 3600 = 1.58836e8 / 3600 ≈ 44121.1 GPU-hours. Then cost = 44121.1 * 1.50 ≈ $66,181.65. But we should do more precisely: 
Compute in petaFLOP-days: 3640.
Number of H200 GPU-days needed: Since one H200 delivers 1.98 petaFLOP/s, in one day it delivers 1.98 * 86400 = 1.98 * 8.64e4 = 1.71072e5 petaFLOP-days? Wait careful: 1 petaFLOP-day is 1 petaFLOP sustained for a whole day. So if an H200 delivers 1.98 petaFLOP/s, then in one day it delivers 1.98 petaFLOP/s * 86400 s = 1.98*86400 petaFLOP = that number is petaFLOP, not petaFLOP-days. To convert to petaFLOP-days, we need to divide by the number of petaFLOP in one petaFLOP-day? Actually, 1 petaFLOP-day = 1 petaFLOP * 1 day = (1e15 FLOP/s) * 86400 s = 8.64e19 FLOP. But if we have an H200 that does 1.98 petaFLOP/s, then in one day it does 1.98 * 86400 petaFLOP = 1.98*86400 * 1e15 FLOP = that is a certain number of FLOP. The number of petaFLOP-days is that FLOP count divided by (8.64e19). Alternatively, we can define: 1 petaFLOP-day = 1 petaFLOP sustained for one day, so if a GPU sustains F petaFLOP/s, then in one day it provides F * 86400 petaFLOP. But 1 petaFLOP-day is equivalent to 1 * 86400 petaFLOP? Actually careful: If you sustain 1 petaFLOP/s for 1 day, you have performed 1 petaFLOP/s * 86400 s = 86400 petaFLOP of operations. So the relationship is: 1 petaFLOP-day = 86400 petaFLOP (where petaFLOP is a unit of operations, not per second). So we can say: Compute in petaFLOP-days = total petaFLOP / 86400. So for GPT-3, total petaFLOP = 3640 * 86400 = 3.14496e8 petaFLOP. Then number of GPU-days needed = total petaFLOP / (petaFLOP per GPU per day) = total petaFLOP / (1.98 * 86400) = (3640 * 86400) / (1.98 * 86400) = 3640 / 1.98 ≈ 1838.38 GPU-days. Then cost: GPU-days * 24 hours/day * $1.50/hour = 1838.38 * 24 * 1.50 = 1838.38 * 36 = $66181.68. So about $66,200. But that seems low for training GPT-3? Actually GPT-3 training cost is estimated in millions of dollars. I recall that training GPT-3 cost around $4.6 million? But that might include other factors. Possibly the numbers given here are simplified. The H200 delivers 1.98 petaFLOP/s? That seems high. The A100 delivers about 0.312 petaFLOP/s for FP16 tensor cores? Actually A100 FP16 peak is 312 TFLOPS = 0.312 petaFLOP/s. H200 might be similar? Wait, H200 is newer, maybe higher. But 1.98 petaFLOP/s seems plausible for FP8 or something? But the problem states "each delivering 1.98 petaFLOP/s". Possibly that's the peak FP16 performance? Actually NVIDIA H100 SXM has 67.9 TFLOPS FP64? No, for AI, we care about FP16/BF16. H100 has about 1.98 petaFLOP/s for FP8? Actually H100 has 1.98 petaOPS for INT8? I'm not sure. But anyway, we'll use the given number.

So cost to train GPT-3 under these assumptions is about $66,200. That is surprisingly low. Possibly they meant 1.98 petaFLOP/s per GPU, but training efficiency is lower, so maybe we should consider that GPUs are not 100% utilized. But the problem doesn't mention utilization, so we assume peak.

Now, for GPT-6, we have C = 10^30 FLOP. Convert to petaFLOP-days: 1 petaFLOP-day = 8.64e19 FLOP. So C in petaFLOP-days = 10^30 / (8.64e19) = (1/8.64) * 10^(30-19) = (1/8.64) * 10^11 = 0.11574 * 10^11 = 1.1574e10 petaFLOP-days.
So GPT-6 requires about 1.1574e10 petaFLOP-days.
Now, number of H200 GPU-days needed = (petaFLOP-days) / (petaFLOP-days per GPU per day)? Actually as before: If one H200 delivers 1.98 petaFLOP/s, then in one day it delivers 1.98 * 86400 petaFLOP = 1.98*86400 = 171072 petaFLOP. But we have compute in petaFLOP-days, so we need to convert: Compute in petaFLOP = C_petaFLOP = (C in petaFLOP-days) * 86400? Actually careful: If we have X petaFLOP-days, that means the total number of petaFLOP is X * 86400. Because 1 petaFLOP-day = 86400 petaFLOP. So total petaFLOP = 1.1574e10 * 86400 = 1.1574e10 * 8.64e4 = 1.1574*8.64 * 10^(10+4) = 10.000736 * 10^14 = 1.0000736e15 petaFLOP. Actually that's huge. Then number of GPU-days = total petaFLOP / (petaFLOP per GPU per day) = total petaFLOP / (1.98 * 86400) = (1.1574e10 * 86400) / (1.98 * 86400) = 1.1574e10 / 1.98 = 5.84545e9 GPU-days. Alternatively, directly: number of GPU-days = (C in petaFLOP-days) / (petaFLOP-days per GPU per day)? But what is petaFLOP-days per GPU per day? If a GPU operates for one day, it delivers a certain amount of compute, which can be expressed in petaFLOP-days. Since 1 petaFLOP-day is 1 petaFLOP sustained for a day, if a GPU sustains F petaFLOP/s, then in one day it delivers F * 86400 petaFLOP, which is equivalent to (F * 86400) / 86400 = F petaFLOP-days? Wait, that's not right. Let's derive properly:

Let F be the GPU's sustained performance in petaFLOP/s. In one day, it performs F * 86400 petaFLOP of operations.
How many petaFLOP-days is that? The definition: 1 petaFLOP-day is the amount of compute equal to sustaining 1 petaFLOP/s for one day, i.e., 1 petaFLOP/s * 86400 s = 86400 petaFLOP. So if we have Q petaFLOP, the equivalent number of petaFLOP-days is Q / 86400. So the compute performed by one GPU in one day, in petaFLOP-days, is (F * 86400) / 86400 = F. So interestingly, if a GPU sustains F petaFLOP/s, then in one day it delivers exactly F petaFLOP-days of compute. Because: Compute in petaFLOP-days = (F petaFLOP/s * 86400 s) / (86400 petaFLOP per petaFLOP-day) = F. So that simplifies things: A GPU that sustains F petaFLOP/s will deliver F petaFLOP-days of compute per day of operation. So for an H200 with 1.98 petaFLOP/s, it delivers 1.98 petaFLOP-days per day. So then the number of GPU-days needed to achieve C petaFLOP-days is simply C / 1.98. Because each GPU-day contributes 1.98 petaFLOP-days. So for GPT-3: 3640 petaFLOP-days / 1.98 ≈ 1838.38 GPU-days. That matches our earlier calculation. For GPT-6: C in petaFLOP-days = 1.1574e10, so GPU-days = 1.1574e10 / 1.98 ≈ 5.84545e9 GPU-days.
Now cost: Each GPU costs $1.50 per hour, so per day (24 hours) it costs 24 * 1.50 = $36 per GPU-day. So total cost = GPU-days * $36 = 5.84545e9 * 36 = 2.10436e11 dollars. That is about $210.4 billion. That seems huge.

But wait, we might also consider that we can use many GPUs in parallel to reduce the wall-clock time. The number of GPU-days is independent of parallelism. So cost is still that.

So answers: Cost to train GPT-3: about $66,200; cost to train GPT-6: about $210 billion.

Part (f): Inference cost and break-even.
For Transformer models, inference requires about 2 FLOPs per parameter per token. So for a 1-trillion-parameter model like GPT-5 (note: it says GPT-5 with 1 trillion parameters, not GPT-6), to generate 1 million tokens, FLOPs needed = (2 FLOP/param/token) * (10^12 parameters) * (10^6 tokens) = 2 * 10^18 FLOP = 2e18 FLOP.
Now, if OpenAI charges $120 per million tokens, how many tokens must be sold to recoup a $1 billion training cost? That is: tokens needed = (training cost) / (price per million tokens) * 1e6 = (1e9 dollars) / (120 dollars per million tokens) * 1e6 = (1e9 / 120) * 1e6 = (1e9 * 1e6) / 120 = 1e15 / 120 = 8.333e12 tokens. So about 8.33 trillion tokens.
Express this in terms of 1000-word essays, assuming 1.4 tokens per word. So each essay has 1000 words * 1.4 tokens/word = 1400 tokens. Number of essays = total tokens / 1400 = 8.333e12 / 1400 = 5.952e9 essays, about 6 billion essays.

But careful: The training cost here is given as $1 billion, which might be different from the GPT-6 training cost we computed. The question says: "how many tokens must be sold to recoup a $1 billion training cost?" So we use that.

Part (g): Environmental impact.
Training GPT-3 emitted roughly 552 tonnes of CO₂. The social cost of carbon is around $112 per tonne. So carbon cost in USD = 552 * 112 = ? 552 * 100 = 55200, 552 * 12 = 6624, total = 61824 dollars. So about $61,824.
For comparison: Producing 1 kg of beef emits about 50 kg of CO₂. A quarter-pound burger contains about 113 g of beef. So first, how much CO₂ per burger? A quarter-pound burger has 113 g beef = 0.113 kg beef. CO₂ per kg beef = 50 kg CO₂. So CO₂ per burger = 0.113 * 50 = 5.65 kg CO₂.
Now, training GPT-3 emitted 552 tonnes = 552,000 kg CO₂. Number of burgers = 552,000 / 5.65 ≈ 97,699 burgers. So about 97,700 burgers.

We should round appropriately since it's order-of-magnitude. So maybe 100,000 burgers.

Now, we need to present answers concisely.

Let's compile answers:

(a) C = 10^30 FLOP, D = 1.7e15 tokens.
(b) Tokens per book: 300 pages/book * 400 words/page * 1.4 tokens/word = 168,000 tokens/book. Number of books = D / 168000 = 1.7e15 / 1.68e5 = 1.012e10 books. Library of Congress has 2e7 books, so about 506 times LoC.
(c) Memory = 2e14 bytes = 200 TB. GPUs needed = 2000 (since each H200 has 100 GB VRAM).
(d) With 2000 GPUs, aggregate bandwidth = 2000 * 4.8 TB/s = 9600 TB/s. Time per forward pass = 200 TB / 9600 TB/s = 0.02083 s. Tokens per minute = 60 / 0.02083 ≈ 2880 tokens.
(e) GPT-3: Compute = 3640 petaFLOP-days. H200 delivers 1.98 petaFLOP-days per day (since 1.98 petaFLOP/s sustained gives 1.98 petaFLOP-days per day). So GPU-days needed = 3640 / 1.98 ≈ 1838.4. Cost per GPU-day = $1.50/hr * 24 = $36. So cost = 1838.4 * 36 ≈ $66,200. For GPT-6: C = 10^30 FLOP = 10^30 / (8.64e19) = 1.157e10 petaFLOP-days. GPU-days = 1.157e10 / 1.98 ≈ 5.845e9. Cost = 5.845e9 * 36 ≈ $2.10e11 = $210 billion.
(f) For 1-trillion-parameter model, FLOPs per million tokens = 2 * 10^12 * 10^6 = 2e18 FLOP. To recoup $1B at $120 per million tokens, tokens needed = (1e9 / 120) * 1e6 = 8.33e12 tokens. In 1000-word essays: each essay = 1400 tokens, so essays = 8.33e12 / 1400 ≈ 5.95e9 essays.
(g) Carbon cost of GPT-3: 552 * 112 = $61,824. CO₂ per burger: 0.113 kg beef * 50 kg CO₂/kg beef = 5.65 kg CO₂. Number of burgers = 552,000 kg CO₂ / 5.65 kg CO₂ per burger ≈ 97,700 burgers.

I'll write answers in a clear, step-by-step manner.

💡 Final Answer
============================================================
### (a) Compute and Dataset Scaling  
Given \( N = 10^{14} \) parameters and Chinchilla laws:  
\[
N = 0.1 \, C^{0.5} \Rightarrow C^{0.5} = \frac{10^{14}}{0.1} = 10^{15} \Rightarrow C = (10^{15})^2 = 10^{30} \text{ FLOP}.
\]  
\[
D = 1.7 \, C^{0.5} = 1.7 \times 10^{15} \text{ tokens}.
\]  

### (b) Dataset Size in Human Terms  
Tokens per book:  
\[
300 \text{ pages/book} \times 400 \text{ words/page} \times 1.4 \text{ tokens/word} = 168,\!000 \text{ tokens/book}.
\]  
Number of books:  
\[
\frac{1.7 \times 10^{15} \text{ tokens}}{1.68 \times 10^5 \text{ tokens/book}} \approx 1.01 \times 10^{10} \text{ books}.
\]  
Library of Congress has \(\sim 2 \times 10^7\) books, so this is about **506 times** larger.

### (c) Memory Requirements  
Memory for parameters:  
\[
10^{14} \text{ parameters} \times 2 \text{ bytes/parameter} = 2 \times 10^{14} \text{ bytes} = 200 \text{ TB}.
\]  
H200 GPUs have 100 GB VRAM each:  
\[
\frac{200,\!000 \text{ GB}}{100 \text{ GB/GPU}} = 2,\!000 \text{ GPUs}.
\]  

### (d) Inference Latency and Throughput  
With 2,000 GPUs, aggregate memory bandwidth:  
\[
2,\!000 \times 4.8 \text{ TB/s} = 9,\!600 \text{ TB/s} = 9.6 \times 10^{15} \text{ bytes/s}.
\]  
Minimal time per forward pass (memory-bound):  
\[
\frac{2 \times 10^{14} \text{ bytes}}{9.6 \times 10^{15} \text{ bytes/s}} \approx 0.0208 \text{ s}.
\]  
Autoregressive generation:  
\[
\text{Tokens per minute} = \frac{60 \text{ s}}{0.0208 \text{ s}} \approx 2,\!880 \text{ tokens}.
\]  

### (e) Training Cost in FLOPs and Dollars  
**GPT-3:**  
Compute = 3,640 petaFLOP-days.  
H200 delivers \(1.98\) petaFLOP/s → \(1.98\) petaFLOP-days per day.  
GPU-days needed:  
\[
\frac{3,\!640}{1.98} \approx 1,\!838.4 \text{ GPU-days}.
\]  
Cost at $1.50/hour per GPU:  
\[
1,\!838.4 \times 24 \times 1.50 \approx \$66,\!200.
\]  

**GPT-6:**  
Compute \(C = 10^{30}\) FLOP:  
\[
\text{petaFLOP-days} = \frac{10^{30}}{8.64 \times 10^{19}} \approx 1.157 \times 10^{10}.
\]  
GPU-days needed:  
\[
\frac{1.157 \times 10^{10}}{1.98} \approx 5.845 \times 10^9.
\]  
Cost:  
\[
5.845 \times 10^9 \times 24 \times 1.50 \approx \$2.10 \times 10^{11} \quad (\text{about } \$210 \text{ billion}).
\]  

### (f) Inference Cost and Break-even  
For 1-trillion-parameter model (GPT-5):  
FLOPs per million tokens:  
\[
2 \text{ FLOP/param/token} \times 10^{12} \text{ params} \times 10^6 \text{ tokens} = 2 \times 10^{18} \text{ FLOP}.
\]  
To recoup $1 billion at $120 per million tokens:  
\[
\frac{10^9}{120} \times 10^6 = 8.33 \times 10^{12} \text{ tokens}.
\]  
In 1000-word essays (1.4 tokens/word):  
\[
\text{Essays} = \frac{8.33 \times 10^{12} \text{ tokens}}{1,\!400 \text{ tokens/essay}} \approx 5.95 \times 10^9 \text{ essays}.
\]  

### (g) Environmental Impact  
Carbon cost of GPT-3:  
\[
552 \text{ tonnes CO}_2 \times 112 \text{ \$/tonne} \approx \$61,\!800.
\]  
CO₂ per quarter-pound burger (113 g beef):  
\[
0.113 \text{ kg beef} \times 50 \text{ kg CO}_2/\text{kg beef} = 5.65 \text{ kg CO}_2.
\]  
Burgers equivalent to GPT-3 training:  
\[
\frac{552,\!000 \text{ kg CO}_2}{5.65 \text{ kg CO}_2/\text{burger}} \approx 97,\!700 \text{ burgers}.
\]
