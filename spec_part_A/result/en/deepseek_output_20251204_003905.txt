We are given: "You are a helpful assistant." and then the problem statement. We need to answer each part step by step.

Let's go through each part.

### **(a) Compute and dataset scaling**

We have Chinchilla scaling laws: For a given compute budget C in FLOP, optimal parameter count N and token count D scale as:
N = 0.1 C^{0.5} and D = 1.7 C^{0.5}.
We are given that GPT-6 has N = 10^{14} parameters.
We need to find C and D.

From N = 0.1 C^{0.5}, we have:
C^{0.5} = N / 0.1 = 10^{14} / 0.1 = 10^{14} / 10^{-1} = 10^{15}.
So C^{0.5} = 10^{15}.
Then C = (10^{15})^2 = 10^{30} FLOP.

Now D = 1.7 C^{0.5} = 1.7 * 10^{15} tokens.
So D ≈ 1.7e15 tokens.

We'll keep it as 1.7 × 10^{15} tokens.

Thus answer:
C = 10^{30} FLOP, D = 1.7 × 10^{15} tokens.

### **(b) Dataset size in human terms**

We have D = 1.7e15 tokens.
Each English word corresponds to about 1.4 tokens.
So number of words = D / 1.4 = (1.7e15) / 1.4 ≈ 1.2143e15 words.
Each page contains 400 words, so number of pages = words / 400 = (1.2143e15) / 400 = 3.03575e12 pages.
Each book has 300 pages, so number of books = pages / 300 = (3.03575e12) / 300 = 1.0119e10 books.
That is approximately 1.01 × 10^{10} books.
The Library of Congress has roughly 20 million volumes = 2 × 10^7 books.
So ratio = (1.01e10) / (2e7) = 505. So about 500 times the size of the Library of Congress.

We'll express: The training dataset corresponds to about 10 billion books, which is about 500 times the size of the Library of Congress.

### **(c) Memory requirements**

Each 16-bit parameter occupies 2 bytes.
Number of parameters: 100 trillion = 10^{14}.
So total memory in bytes = 2 × 10^{14} bytes.
Now convert to GB and TB:
1 GB = 10^9 bytes, so memory in GB = (2e14) / 1e9 = 2e5 GB = 200,000 GB.
In TB: 1 TB = 10^{12} bytes, so memory in TB = (2e14) / 1e12 = 200 TB.
Alternatively, 200,000 GB / 1000 = 200 TB (since 1 TB = 1000 GB typically? Actually careful: In computing, sometimes 1 TB = 1024 GB, but for estimation we use powers of 10. The problem says "in GB or TB", so we can give both: 2e5 GB or 2e2 TB.
Given an H200 GPU has about 100 GB of VRAM. To hold the model in memory, number of GPUs needed = total memory / memory per GPU = 200,000 GB / 100 GB = 2000 GPUs.
But note: This is just to store the model parameters. In practice, during training you need additional memory for gradients, optimizer states, activations, etc., so more GPUs would be needed. But the question says "just to hold the model in memory", so 2000 GPUs.

### **(d) Inference latency and throughput**

During inference, model parameters must be loaded from GPU memory. The H200 has memory bandwidth of 4.8 TB/s.
We need the minimal time to perform one forward pass through GPT-6. For a single forward pass, we need to read all parameters once? Actually, in a naive sense, each parameter is used at least once during a forward pass. But more precisely, for a transformer model, the number of FLOPs per token is about 2 * N (where N is number of parameters). But here they ask: "minimal time in seconds to perform one forward pass through GPT-6?" They mention "model parameters must be loaded from GPU memory." So they might be thinking of the memory bandwidth bottleneck: to perform a forward pass, we need to load all parameters from memory into the compute units. That is, the time is at least the time to transfer the model parameters from memory to the cores. So minimal time = (size of parameters in bytes) / (memory bandwidth).

But careful: The memory bandwidth is 4.8 TB/s = 4.8 × 10^{12} bytes/s. 
Size of parameters = 2 × 10^{14} bytes.
So time = (2e14 bytes) / (4.8e12 bytes/s) = (2/4.8) × 10^{2} s = (0.4167) × 100 s ≈ 41.67 seconds.
That is the minimal time just to load the parameters. However, in practice, the forward pass also involves computation, but the question likely focuses on the memory bandwidth limit. It says: "During inference, model parameters must be loaded from GPU memory. The H200 has a memory bandwidth of 4.8 TB/s. What is the minimal time in seconds to perform one forward pass through GPT-6?" So yes, it's the time to read all parameters from memory once. So about 41.7 seconds.

But wait: Could there be overlap? Minimal time might be lower if parameters are cached? But they say "minimal time", so probably the bandwidth-bound time. So we'll compute: 
time = (200 TB) / (4.8 TB/s) = 200/4.8 ≈ 41.67 s.

Now, if the model generates tokens autoregressively (one token per forward pass), then each forward pass takes at least that time. So tokens per second = 1 / (41.67 s) ≈ 0.024 tokens/s.
In one minute: tokens = 60 seconds * (1/41.67) tokens/s ≈ 60/41.67 ≈ 1.44 tokens.
That seems very low. But perhaps we misinterpret: The memory bandwidth is for the entire GPU. But if we have multiple GPUs, the parameters are distributed. The question says "Given that an H200 GPU has about 100 GB of VRAM" from part (c), we needed 2000 GPUs to hold the model. So in inference, we would use multiple GPUs. But the memory bandwidth given is per GPU? It says "The H200 has a memory bandwidth of 4.8 TB/s." That is per GPU. But if we have 2000 GPUs, the aggregate bandwidth is 2000 * 4.8 TB/s = 9600 TB/s. Then the minimal time to load all parameters across all GPUs would be: total parameters size / aggregate bandwidth = 200 TB / (2000 * 4.8 TB/s) = 200 / 9600 = 0.02083 s. That is much faster. But careful: The question in part (d) does not explicitly state how many GPUs are used for inference. It says "During inference, model parameters must be loaded from GPU memory. The H200 has a memory bandwidth of 4.8 TB/s." It might be considering a single GPU? But from part (c), we know a single GPU cannot hold the model. So inference would necessarily use multiple GPUs. However, the question might be testing the simple calculation: if we had to load all parameters from a single GPU's memory, but that's impossible because the model doesn't fit. Alternatively, they might expect us to use the single GPU bandwidth and the total model size, ignoring that it doesn't fit. Or maybe they assume the model is split across many GPUs and we need to consider the aggregate bandwidth? The problem statement in (d) does not mention the number of GPUs. It just gives the H200 specs. Possibly we are to assume that we have enough GPUs to hold the model, and the aggregate bandwidth is the sum of individual bandwidths? But the question says "the H200 has a memory bandwidth of 4.8 TB/s", implying per GPU. To be safe, I'll compute both: one assuming a single GPU (even though it can't hold the model, but as a theoretical minimal time if we could stream the parameters from memory? Actually, even if the model doesn't fit, the minimal time to do a forward pass would be bounded by the time to load the parameters from some memory hierarchy. But likely they want the simple calculation: time = model size / bandwidth.

Given that in part (c) we computed the number of GPUs needed just to store the model, maybe we should use that number to compute aggregate bandwidth. But the question in (d) doesn't refer to part (c) explicitly. It says: "During inference, model parameters must be loaded from GPU memory. The H200 has a memory bandwidth of 4.8 TB/s." I think it's natural to assume that we are using enough GPUs to hold the model, and the aggregate memory bandwidth is proportional to the number of GPUs. However, the question doesn't specify the number of GPUs. Possibly they expect the calculation assuming the model is stored on a single H200? But that contradicts part (c). Alternatively, maybe they want us to compute the time if we had to load the entire model from memory per forward pass, but that is not how inference works typically; parameters are already in memory and are accessed many times. Actually, for a single forward pass, each parameter is used at least once, so the total data that must be read from memory is at least the size of the parameters (if they are not cached in a smaller cache). So the time is lower bounded by model size / bandwidth. If we have multiple GPUs, the model is distributed, so each GPU only holds a portion, and the bandwidth aggregates. But there might also be communication overhead. The simplest answer: Use the total model size and the per-GPU bandwidth, but note that we need multiple GPUs. However, the question asks: "What is the minimal time in seconds to perform one forward pass through GPT-6?" Possibly the minimal time is achieved when we have enough GPUs such that the model is fully stored in VRAM and the bandwidth is fully utilized. The minimal time would then be the time to read each parameter once from VRAM, but since they are already in VRAM, the read time is essentially the time to transfer them from VRAM to the cores. That is per GPU. But if the model is partitioned across GPUs, each GPU only reads its own parameters, so the time per GPU is (size per GPU) / (bandwidth per GPU). And since they work in parallel, the overall forward pass time is the maximum among GPUs. So if we have P GPUs, each holds ~ (total parameters)/P, and the time per GPU is (model size / P) / bandwidth. That time is independent of P? Actually, it is (model size)/(P * bandwidth). So as we increase P, the time decreases. But there is a limit: we need at least enough GPUs to store the model. From (c), we need 2000 GPUs. So with 2000 GPUs, each holds 100 GB, and bandwidth per GPU is 4.8 TB/s, so each GPU reads 100 GB? Wait, careful: For a forward pass, each GPU needs to read its own parameters from its own VRAM. But the parameters are already in VRAM, so the read is from VRAM to the cores. The bandwidth is the memory bandwidth between VRAM and the cores. So if each GPU holds a fraction of the model, say M_i bytes, then the time for that GPU to read its parameters is M_i / (4.8 TB/s). But if we split evenly, M_i = total size / number of GPUs. With 2000 GPUs, M_i = 200 TB / 2000 = 0.1 TB = 100 GB. Bandwidth per GPU is 4.8 TB/s = 4800 GB/s. So time per GPU = 100 GB / 4800 GB/s = 0.02083 s. So the forward pass time is determined by the slowest GPU, which is about 0.0208 s. But is that realistic? In transformer inference, there is also communication between GPUs because layers might be sequential. However, for minimal time, if we assume perfect parallelism, maybe it's possible. But likely the question expects a simpler calculation: just model size divided by bandwidth, assuming a single memory system. Since the problem says "the H200 has a memory bandwidth of 4.8 TB/s", it might be referring to a single GPU. But then the model doesn't fit. I'll check the numbers: model size = 200 TB, bandwidth = 4.8 TB/s, time = 200/4.8 ≈ 41.7 s. That is a clean number. With 2000 GPUs, aggregate bandwidth = 2000*4.8 = 9600 TB/s, time = 200/9600 ≈ 0.0208 s, which is also a clean number. Which one is more likely? The problem statement in (d) says: "During inference, model parameters must be loaded from GPU memory." That suggests that parameters are stored in GPU memory, and we need to load them (presumably into the cache or registers). So if we have many GPUs, they are loaded in parallel. I think the intended interpretation is that we have enough GPUs to hold the model, and we use the per-GPU bandwidth, but the time is computed as the time to load the portion on each GPU. However, the question does not specify the number of GPUs. Possibly we are to use the number from part (c)? The problem is broken into parts, and part (c) asked for the number of GPUs to hold the model. So it's natural to use that number in part (d). But part (d) doesn't explicitly say "using the number of GPUs from (c)". However, it says "Given that an H200 GPU has about 100 GB of VRAM" in part (c), but in part (d) it only gives the bandwidth. I think it's reasonable to assume that for inference we also use the same number of GPUs as needed to store the model, because otherwise the model wouldn't fit. So I'll compute using 2000 GPues. But let's read part (d) carefully: "During inference, model parameters must be loaded from GPU memory. The H200 has a memory bandwidth of 4.8 TB/s. What is the minimal time in seconds to perform one forward pass through GPT-6?" It doesn't mention multiple GPUs. Possibly they want the time if we had to load the model from memory to the processor, but if the model is too big, we might have to load it in chunks. The minimal time might then be the time to load the entire model once, assuming we can overlap computation with loading? But they say "minimal time", so it's a lower bound. I'll check typical Fermi estimation problems: They often make simplifying assumptions. Maybe they expect: time = model size / bandwidth = 2e14 bytes / (4.8e12 bytes/s) = 41.67 s. Then tokens per minute = 60/41.67 ≈ 1.44 tokens. That is a striking number: it would take about 42 seconds to generate one token! That seems very slow, but maybe that's the point: with such a huge model, inference is bottlenecked by memory bandwidth. Alternatively, if we use many GPUs, we can get much higher throughput. Given that part (e) talks about training cost using H200 GPUs, it's likely that we consider multiple GPUs. But for inference, the question might be considering a single forward pass on a single GPU? That doesn't make sense because the model doesn't fit. I'll re-read: The problem says "hypothetical GPT-6 model with 100 trillion parameters". In part (c), we computed that it takes 2000 H200 GPUs to just hold the model. So for inference, we would use at least 2000 GPUs. So I'll compute the minimal time assuming perfect parallelism across 2000 GPUs. But then the minimal time per forward pass would be the time for the slowest stage. If the model is partitioned across GPUs, perhaps each GPU does a part of the computation, and there is sequential dependency across layers. For a transformer, the forward pass goes through all layers sequentially. If we use pipeline parallelism, we can have different GPUs handle different layers, but the tokens must flow through the pipeline. For a single token, the latency is the sum of the times for each layer. If each layer's computation is memory-bandwidth bound, then the time per layer might be the time to load the parameters for that layer. If we have many GPUs, each layer's parameters might be on a different GPU, so we need to transfer activations between GPUs. That adds communication time. But the question likely simplifies: assume that all parameters need to be loaded from memory once per forward pass, and that loading can happen in parallel across all GPUs. So the minimal time is the time to load the largest chunk of parameters from any single GPU's memory. If the model is evenly distributed, each GPU holds 100 GB. Then time per GPU to load its parameters = 100 GB / (4.8 TB/s) = 100 / 4800 = 0.02083 s. But wait, is that the time to load all parameters on that GPU? For a forward pass, the GPU might need to load different parameters for different layers. If the entire model portion on that GPU is 100 GB, and the bandwidth is 4.8 TB/s, then the time to read all 100 GB is 0.02083 s. However, if the GPU processes layers sequentially, it might need to load parameters for each layer separately, and the total amount read might still be 100 GB (if each parameter is read exactly once). So the total time to read all parameters from VRAM on that GPU is 0.02083 s. And since all GPUs do this in parallel, the overall forward pass time is 0.02083 s. That seems plausible. But then the tokens per minute would be 60/0.02083 ≈ 2880 tokens per minute, or about 48 tokens per second. That is more reasonable for a huge model? Actually, current large models generate tokens at maybe 10-20 tokens per second on multiple GPUs. So 48 tokens per second for a 100T parameter model seems optimistic. But we are doing a Fermi estimate, so order of magnitude is fine.

I'll check the problem's context: It says "Fermi Estimation for Large-scale Deep Learning Models", so we are doing rough, order-of-magnitude calculations. Possibly the simplest answer is to take the model size and divide by the bandwidth, giving ~40 seconds per token. That would be a striking result, highlighting the memory wall. But then part (d) also asks: "how many tokens could it output in one minute?" If it's 1.44 tokens per minute, that is very slow. That might be intended to show that such a large model is impractical for autoregressive generation if we don't use model parallelism effectively. However, in reality, we do use model parallelism, so the time would be much lower. Given that the problem mentions "minimal time", perhaps they mean the fundamental limit based on memory bandwidth if we had to read every parameter from memory once. That limit is independent of the number of GPUs if we consider the aggregate bandwidth. If we have enough GPUs to hold the model, the aggregate bandwidth increases linearly with the number of GPUs, so the minimal time decreases. But is there a limit to how many GPUs we can use? We can use as many as needed to hold the model, but then the aggregate bandwidth is proportional to the number of GPUs, so the time becomes: time = (model size) / (number of GPUs * bandwidth per GPU) = (model size per GPU) / (bandwidth per GPU). That is constant if we fix the model size per GPU. In other words, if we want to minimize time, we would use as many GPUs as possible to reduce the model size per GPU, but there is a lower bound: we need at least one GPU per parameter? No, but we are limited by the memory per GPU. The minimal time per forward pass, if we assume perfect parallelism and no communication overhead, is the time it takes for the GPU with the largest share to read its parameters. To minimize that, we would maximize the number of GPUs subject to the constraint that each GPU can hold its share. The maximum number of GPUs is determined by the total model size and the memory per GPU: we need at least total size / memory per GPU GPUs. That number is 2000. With 2000 GPUs, each holds 100 GB, and the time per GPU to read 100 GB at 4.8 TB/s is 0.02083 s. So the minimal possible time is about 0.021 seconds. That is one order of magnitude. Alternatively, if we consider that parameters might be reused, and we might have caches, the time could be even lower. But the question says "minimal time", so maybe we should take the lower bound. I'll check the numbers: 0.02083 s is about 21 milliseconds. That seems plausible for a forward pass of a huge model on many GPUs? For comparison, GPT-3 175B parameters might take a few hundred milliseconds per token on a single GPU? Actually, with optimizations, it's faster. But 100T is about 570 times larger than 175B (since 175e9 vs 1e14, ratio ~571). So if GPT-3 takes 0.1 s per token on a single GPU, then 100T might take 57 seconds on a single GPU if scaling linearly, which is close to our 41.67 s. But with many GPUs, we can parallelize. So both numbers are interesting.

Given that the problem is a Fermi estimation, and they likely want simple calculations, I'll go with the simplest: time = model size in bytes / memory bandwidth. Because that doesn't require assuming the number of GPUs. And they didn't ask for the number of GPUs in (d), only in (c). So in (d), we can compute independently. I'll assume that we have enough GPUs such that the model is in memory, but the memory bandwidth given is per GPU, and we need to consider how many GPUs are involved. However, the problem statement in (d) does not mention the number of GPUs. It might be that they expect us to use the total model size and the per-GPU bandwidth, implying that we are considering a single GPU trying to do inference by loading parameters in chunks? That would be unrealistic but maybe for a Fermi estimate. I'll look at part (e) where they mention "trained on H200 GPUs", so they are considering multiple GPUs. But for inference, it's ambiguous.

I'll check the overall problem: It says "You'll explore scaling laws, memory, inference, cost, and environmental impact using rough, order-of-magnitude calculations." So we should keep calculations simple and round numbers.

Maybe the intended calculation for (d) is: 
Model size = 2e14 bytes.
Bandwidth = 4.8 TB/s = 4.8e12 bytes/s.
Time = 2e14 / 4.8e12 = (2/4.8)*1e2 = 41.67 s ≈ 40 s.
Then tokens per minute = 60/40 = 1.5 tokens.
That is a striking result: with such a large model, you can only generate about 1.5 tokens per minute if limited by memory bandwidth. That might be the point: to show that inference is extremely slow unless you have massive parallelism or other optimizations.

Given that, I'll go with that. Also, in many Fermi estimation problems, they often do such straightforward divisions without worrying about multiple GPUs unless specified.

So I'll answer: 
Minimal time for one forward pass ≈ 42 seconds.
Tokens per minute ≈ 1.4 tokens.

But let's do exact calculations with scientific notation.

Compute: 
Model size = 100 trillion parameters * 2 bytes = 2e14 bytes.
Bandwidth = 4.8 TB/s = 4.8 * 10^12 bytes/s (since 1 TB = 10^12 bytes).
Time = 2e14 / 4.8e12 = (2/4.8) * 10^(14-12) = 0.4167 * 10^2 = 41.67 s.
So about 4.2e1 seconds.
Tokens per minute: 60 seconds / 41.67 s/token ≈ 1.44 tokens, so about 1.4 tokens.

I'll use 42 seconds and 1.4 tokens per minute.

### **(e) Training cost in FLOPs and dollars**

First, we have GPT-3 required 3640 petaFLOP-days to train.
One petaFLOP-day = 8.64e19 FLOP.
So training compute for GPT-3 in FLOP: C_GPT3 = 3640 * 8.64e19 = ? We'll compute.
3640 = 3.64e3, times 8.64e19 = 3.64*8.64 * 10^(3+19) = 31.4496 * 10^22 = 3.14496e23 FLOP. Roughly 3.1e23 FLOP.

But the question asks: "If trained on H200 GPUs (each delivering 1.98 petaFLOP/s and renting for $1.50/hour), how much would it cost to train GPT-3?" 

We need to compute the cost. First, find the total FLOPs required for GPT-3. But we already have it in petaFLOP-days. Alternatively, we can compute the time it would take on a single H200 GPU, then multiply by rental cost.

Each H200 delivers 1.98 petaFLOP/s. That is 1.98e15 FLOP/s.
Total FLOPs for GPT-3: from above, 3640 petaFLOP-days. But careful: petaFLOP-day means petaFLOP per day? Actually, it's a unit of compute: doing 1 petaFLOP for one day. So 1 petaFLOP-day = (1e15 FLOP/s) * (86400 s) = 8.64e19 FLOP, as given.
So total FLOPs for GPT-3 = 3640 * 8.64e19 FLOP.
Time on one H200: time = total FLOPs / (FLOP/s per GPU) = (3640 * 8.64e19) / (1.98e15) seconds.
Compute step by step:
First, compute FLOPs: 3640 * 8.64e19 = 3.64e3 * 8.64e19 = 3.64*8.64 * 10^(3+19) = 31.4496e22 = 3.14496e23 FLOP.
Per H200: 1.98e15 FLOP/s.
Time in seconds = 3.14496e23 / 1.98e15 = (3.14496/1.98) * 10^(23-15) = 1.58836 * 10^8 seconds.
Now convert to hours: 1 hour = 3600 seconds, so time in hours = 1.58836e8 / 3600 = (1.58836e8)/(3.6e3) = 4.4121e4 hours ≈ 44,121 hours.
Rental cost: $1.50 per GPU-hour. So cost on one GPU = 44,121 * 1.50 = $66,181.5.
But training is done on many GPUs in parallel to reduce time. The question says "trained on H200 GPUs", implying we use multiple GPUs. We need to know how many GPUs are used? Actually, the cost would depend on how many GPUs we use and for how long. Typically, we choose a number of GPUs to complete training in a certain time. But the question likely expects: We compute the total GPU-hours required, and then multiply by cost per GPU-hour. That is, total FLOPs divided by FLOPs per GPU per second gives GPU-seconds, then convert to GPU-hours. That gives the total number of GPU-hours needed, regardless of how many GPUs are used in parallel. So cost = (total GPU-hours) * ($1.50 per hour).

So we already computed total GPU-seconds = total FLOPs / (FLOP/s per GPU) = 1.58836e8 seconds.
Total GPU-hours = 1.58836e8 / 3600 = 4.4121e4 hours.
Cost = 4.4121e4 * 1.50 = $66,181.5 ≈ $66,000.
But that seems low? Training GPT-3 cost millions of dollars. Possibly because the H200 is much more powerful than the GPUs used for GPT-3? GPT-3 was trained on V100s, which have lower FLOPs. Also, the rental cost of $1.50 per hour for an H200 seems low; actual cloud costs might be higher. But this is a Fermi estimate. So we'll go with that.

Alternatively, we can compute using petaFLOP-days directly. 
One H200 delivers 1.98 petaFLOP/s. How many petaFLOP-days per second? 1 petaFLOP-day = 1 petaFLOP sustained for a day. So the rate of 1.98 petaFLOP/s means that in one second, it does 1.98 petaFLOP. In one day, it would do 1.98 * 86400 = 1.98 * 8.64e4 = about 1.71e5 petaFLOP? Actually, careful: petaFLOP/s * seconds in a day = petaFLOP per day. So one H200 running for one day delivers 1.98 * 86400 = 1.98 * 8.64e4 = 1.71072e5 petaFLOP? That is not a petaFLOP-day; it's petaFLOP per day. Actually, 1 petaFLOP-day is exactly 1 petaFLOP sustained for one day, so it is 1 * (86400 seconds) = 86400 petaFLOP-seconds? Wait, confusing.

Better: Compute the number of H200-days needed. 
We need 3640 petaFLOP-days of compute.
Each H200 delivers 1.98 petaFLOP/s. How many petaFLOP-days does one H200 deliver per day? If it runs for one day at 1.98 petaFLOP/s, then total FLOPs in that day = 1.98 * 86400 = 1.98 * 8.64e4 = 1.71072e5 petaFLOP? But that's not in petaFLOP-days. To convert to petaFLOP-days, note that 1 petaFLOP-day = 1 petaFLOP sustained for 1 day = (1 petaFLOP/s) * 86400 s = 86400 petaFLOP. So the number of petaFLOP-days is total petaFLOP / 86400. Alternatively, if an H200 runs for one day, it produces: (1.98 petaFLOP/s) * 86400 s = 1.98*86400 petaFLOP. To express in petaFLOP-days, divide by 86400: (1.98*86400)/86400 = 1.98 petaFLOP-days? That would mean that an H200 running for one day delivers 1.98 petaFLOP-days? That seems off because 1 petaFLOP-day is a lot. Actually, let's clarify: The unit "petaFLOP-day" is a unit of compute, not rate. It is equivalent to performing 10^15 floating point operations per second for one day, so total operations = 10^15 * 86400 = 8.64e19 FLOP. So if a GPU has a rate of R petaFLOP/s, then in one day it delivers R * 86400 petaFLOP? Wait, careful: 1 petaFLOP/s = 10^15 FLOP/s. So in one day, it delivers 10^15 * 86400 FLOP = 8.64e19 FLOP = 1 petaFLOP-day. So indeed, if a GPU runs at 1 petaFLOP/s for one day, it delivers exactly 1 petaFLOP-day of compute. So if an H200 delivers 1.98 petaFLOP/s, then running it for one day delivers 1.98 petaFLOP-days of compute. So that's simpler: One H200-day (24 hours) provides 1.98 petaFLOP-days of compute.
Therefore, to achieve 3640 petaFLOP-days, we need (3640 / 1.98) H200-days = about 1838.38 H200-days.
That is the total number of GPU-days required.
Now, each H200-day is 24 hours, so total GPU-hours = 1838.38 * 24 = 44121 hours. That matches our previous calculation.
Cost per GPU-hour = $1.50, so total cost = 44121 * 1.50 = $66,181.5.
So that's consistent.

Now for GPT-6: We computed C from part (a) as 10^30 FLOP.
We need to compute the cost to train GPT-6 under the same assumptions.
First, convert C to petaFLOP-days? Or use the same method.
C = 10^30 FLOP.
One petaFLOP-day = 8.64e19 FLOP.
So C in petaFLOP-days = 10^30 / (8.64e19) = (1/8.64) * 10^(30-19) = (1/8.64) * 10^11 = about 1.1574e10 petaFLOP-days.
That is 1.1574 × 10^10 petaFLOP-days.
Now, each H200 delivers 1.98 petaFLOP-days per day (as argued above). So the number of H200-days needed = (1.1574e10) / 1.98 = about 5.845e9 H200-days.
Total GPU-hours = 5.845e9 * 24 = 1.4028e11 hours.
Cost at $1.50 per GPU-hour = 1.4028e11 * 1.50 = 2.1042e11 dollars = about $2.1e11, or $210 billion.
That is a huge number.

We can also compute directly from FLOPs:
Total FLOPs = 10^30.
H200 FLOP/s = 1.98e15 FLOP/s.
GPU-seconds = 10^30 / 1.98e15 = (1/1.98) * 10^(30-15) = 0.505 * 10^15 = 5.05e14 seconds.
GPU-hours = 5.05e14 / 3600 = 1.4028e11 hours. Same.
Cost = 1.4028e11 * 1.50 = 2.1042e11 dollars.

So cost for GPT-6 ≈ $2.1 × 10^11.

### **(f) Inference cost and break-even**

We are asked: For Transformer models, inference requires about 2 FLOPs per parameter per token. 
First: How many FLOPs are needed to generate 1 million tokens with a 1-trillion-parameter model like GPT-5?
Parameters = 1 trillion = 10^12.
FLOPs per token = 2 * N = 2 * 10^12 = 2e12 FLOP per token.
For 1 million tokens = 10^6 tokens, total FLOPs = 2e12 * 1e6 = 2e18 FLOP.
So answer: 2 × 10^18 FLOP.

Next: If OpenAI charges $120 per million tokens, how many tokens must be sold to recoup a $1 billion training cost?
Training cost = $1e9.
Revenue per million tokens = $120.
So number of million token units needed = 1e9 / 120 = 8.333e6 million tokens.
That is 8.333 × 10^6 million tokens = 8.333 × 10^6 × 10^6 = 8.333 × 10^12 tokens.
So total tokens to sell = 8.333e12 tokens.

Express this in terms of 1000-word essays, assuming 1.4 tokens per word.
Each 1000-word essay has 1000 words * 1.4 tokens per word = 1400 tokens.
Number of essays = total tokens / 1400 = 8.333e12 / 1400 = (8.333e12)/(1.4e3) = 5.952e9 essays.
So about 6 billion essays.

### **(g) Environmental impact**

Training GPT-3 emitted roughly 552 tonnes of CO₂.
Social cost of carbon is around $112 per tonne.
Carbon cost in USD = 552 * 112 = ?
552 * 112 = 552 * 100 + 552 * 12 = 55200 + 6624 = 61824 dollars.
So about $61,824.

For comparison: Producing 1 kg of beef emits about 50 kg of CO₂.
A quarter-pound burger contains about 113 g of beef.
We need to find how many burgers' worth of CO₂ does training GPT-3 represent.

First, find the CO₂ emissions per burger.
Beef per burger: 113 g = 0.113 kg.
CO₂ per kg beef = 50 kg CO₂.
So CO₂ per burger = 0.113 * 50 = 5.65 kg CO₂ per burger.
Training GPT-3 emits 552 tonnes of CO₂ = 552,000 kg CO₂.
Number of burgers = 552,000 / 5.65 ≈ ?
Compute: 552000 / 5.65 = (552000 * 100) / 565 = 55200000 / 565 ≈ 97699. So about 97,700 burgers.
More precisely: 5.65 * 100,000 = 565,000, so 552,000 / 5.65 = 552000 / 5.65 = divide: 5.65 * 97699.1 = 552000? Let's do: 5.65 * 97,699 =? Actually, 552000 / 5.65 = 552000 ÷ (565/100) = 552000 * (100/565) = 55,200,000 / 565 = divide 565 into 55,200,000: 565 * 97,699 =? I'll compute: 565 * 97,700 = 565 * 100,000 = 56,500,000 minus 565 * 2,300 = 1,299,500, so 56,500,000 - 1,299,500 = 55,200,500, close. So about 97,700.
So approximately 98,000 burgers.

We can also do order of magnitude: 552 tonnes = 5.52e5 kg. CO₂ per burger ~5.65 kg, so number ~1e5. So about 100,000 burgers.

Now we have all answers.

Let's write them concisely.

I'll structure the final answer with headings.
